<h1>Active Directory Home Lab</h1>


 ### [Youtube video for the Project]()

<h2>Description</h2>
This project demonstrates the setup and configuration of a basic Active Directory environment that resembles a small corporate network. This project will be a walkthrough of everything to get the lab running and the clients internal network connected to the internet through the domain controller. I used a Python script to add 100 users and configure them for me. I will be doing more with this lab setup for future projects and will be removing most of the 1000 users and readding more in the future. This showcases efficient automation and a seamless integration of users into the network infrastructure.

Next make sure to select "Windows 10 pro" and NOT home edition for this lab. Next, select "Custom install", and then on the next screen, select your Drive. For the next screen I selected "Limited Experience", but if you need to select the other option you can. I named the PC "User" for this lab, and left the password blank. We should be logged into the home screen now.: <br/>
